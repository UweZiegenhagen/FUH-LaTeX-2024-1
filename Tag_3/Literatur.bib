The state with the lowest mass is identified with the boson, which has been discovered recently at the "Large Hadron Collider" at CERN. Specific properties of the excited weak bosons are studied, in particular their decays into weak bosons and into photons.},

  abstract     = {Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) integrates computer-generated virtual objects with physical environments for mobile devices. MAR systems enable users to interact with MAR devices, such as smartphones and head-worn wearables, and performs seamless transitions from the physical world to a mixed world with digital entities. These MAR systems support user experiences by using MAR devices to provide universal accessibility to digital contents. Over the past 20 years, a number of MAR systems have been developed, however, the studies and design of MAR frameworks have not yet been systematically reviewed from the perspective of user-centric design. This article presents the first effort of surveying existing MAR frameworks (count: 37) and further discusses the latest studies on MAR through a top-down approach: 1) MAR applications; 2) MAR visualisation techniques adaptive to user mobility and contexts; 3) systematic evaluation of MAR frameworks including supported platforms and corresponding features such as tracking, feature extraction plus sensing capabilities; and 4) underlying machine learning approaches supporting intelligent operations within MAR systems. Finally, we summarise the development of emerging research fields, current state-of-the-art, and discuss the important open challenges and possible theoretical and technical directions. This survey aims to benefit both researchers and MAR system developers alike.},

First we prove that an almost cosymplectic $(\kappa,\mu)$-manifold is Einstein or cosymplectic if it admits a closed Einstein-Weyl structure or two Einstein-Weyl structures. Next for a three dimensional compact almost $\alpha$-cosymplectic manifold admitting closed Einstein-Weyl structures, we prove that it is Ricc-flat. Further, we show that an almost $\alpha$-cosymplectic admitting two Einstein-Weyl structures is either Einstein or $\alpha$-cosymplectic, provided that its Ricci tensor is commuting. Finally, we prove that a compact $K$-cosymplectic manifold with a closed Einstein-Weyl structure or two special Einstein-Weyl structures is cosymplectic.},
